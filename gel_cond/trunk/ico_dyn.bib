  abstract = {Crystal nucleation is a much-studied phenomenon, yet the rate at which
	it occurs remains difficult to predict. Small crystal nuclei form
	spontaneously in supersaturated solutions, but unless their size
	exceeds a critical value--the so-called critical nucleus--they will
	re-dissolve rather than grow. It is this rate-limiting step that
	has proved difficult to probe experimentally. The crystal nucleation
	rate depends on Pcrit, the (very small) probability that a critical
	nucleus forms spontaneously, and on a kinetic factor (kappa) that
	measures the rate at which critical nuclei subsequently grow. Given
	the absence of a priori knowledge of either quantity, classical nucleation
	theory is commonly used to analyse crystal nucleation experiments,
	with the unconstrained parameters adjusted to fit the observations.
	This approach yields no 'first principles' prediction of absolute
	nucleation rates. Here we approach the problem from a different angle,
	simulating the nucleation process in a suspension of hard colloidal
	spheres, to obtain quantitative numerical predictions of the crystal
	nucleation rate. We find large discrepancies between the computed
	nucleation rates and those deduced from experiments: the best experimental
	estimates of Pcrit seem to be too large by several orders of magnitude.},

	of a true glass state, distinct from liquid and solid, remains elusive:
	Glasses are liquids that have become too viscous to flow. An old
	idea, as yet unproven experimentally, is that the dynamics becomes
	sluggish as the glass transition approaches, because increasingly
	larger regions of the material have to move simultaneously to allow
	flow. We introduce new multipoint dynamical susceptibilities to estimate
	quantitatively the size of these regions and provide direct experimental
	evidence that the glass formation of molecular liquids and colloidal
	suspensions is accompanied by growing dynamic correlation length
	scales.},

  abstract = {NetworkX is a Python language package for exploration and analysis
	of networks and network algorithms. The core package provides data
	structures for representing many types of networks, or graphs, including
	simple graphs, directed graphs, and graphs with parallel edges and
	self-loops. The nodes in NetworkX graphs can be any (hashable) Python
	object and edges can contain arbitrary data; this flexibility makes
	NetworkX ideal for representing networks found in many different
	scientific fields. In addition to the basic data structures many
	graph algorithms are implemented for calculating network properties
	and structure measures: shortest paths, betweenness centrality, clustering,
	and degree distribution and many more. NetworkX can read and write
	various graph formats for easy exchange with existing data, and provides
	generators for many classic graphs and popular graph models, such
	as the Erdos-Renyi, Small World, and Barabasi-Albert models. The
	ease-of-use and flexibility of the Python programming language together
	with connection to the SciPy tools make NetworkX a powerful tool
	for scientific computations. We discuss some of our recent work studying
	synchronization of coupled oscillators to demonstrate how NetworkX
	enables research in the field of computational networks.},

	an interparticle 'depletion' attraction whose range and depth can
	be 'tuned' independently by altering the polymer's molecular weight
	and concentration respectively. Over the past decade, one particularly
	simple experimental realization of such a mixture has been studied
	in considerable detail: nearly-hard-sphere particles of poly(methyl
	methacrylate) and random-coil polystyrene dispersed in simple hydrocarbon
	solvents (mainly cis-decalin). The simplicity of the system has enabled
	rather detailed comparison of experimental findings with theory and
	simulation. Here I review the current understanding of the equilibrium
	phase behaviour, structure, phase transition kinetics, and metastability
	of this Model colloid-polymer mixture. These findings form a useful
	reference point for understanding more complex mixtures. Moreover,
	in some cases, insights gained from studying this model system have
	relevance beyond soft-condensed-matter physics, e.g. in understanding
	the liquid state, in controlling protein crystallization, and in
	elucidating the nature of glasses.},

	theories in condensed matter and statistical physics, from crystal
	nucleation to the glass transition. A single parameter, the volume
	fraction (phi), characterizes an ideal, monodisperse hard-sphere
	suspension. In comparing experiments with theories and simulation,
	researchers to date have paid little attention to likely uncertainties
	in experimentally-quoted phi values. We critically review the experimental
	measurement of phi in hard-sphere colloids, and show that while statistical
	uncertainties in comparing relative values of phi can be as low as
	0.0001, systematic errors of 3-6\% are probably unavoidable. The
	consequences of this are illustrated by way of a case study comparing
	literature data sets on hard-sphere viscosity and diffusion.},

	its efficacy with two well-known systems for which accurate theories

	The high sensitivity of this method allows for the precise determination
	of complex interactions, as exemplified, for example, by the accurate
	resolution of the oscillatory effective potential of the binary hard
	sphere system. We argue that the method is particularly well suited

  abstract = {The phase behavior and concentration fluctuations in suspensions of
	hard sphere colloids and nonadsorbing polymers under nearly ideal
	solvent conditions is studied experimentally. A remarkably different
	qualitative behavior compared to the athermal solvent case is observed
	for the dependence on polymer/particle size asymmetry of both the
	gelation and fluid-fluid phase separation boundaries. Near the theta
	state the effect of increasing the range of depletion attractions
	leads to a weak monotonic destabilization of the homogeneous phase
	at high particle volume fractions, with a reversal of the trend at
	lower volume fractions. In stark contrast to athermal solvent behavior,
	this nonmonotonic behavior results in multiple "curve crossings"
	of gel and phase separation boundaries as the polymer/particle size
	ratio is varied. Quantitative comparisons with no adjustable parameter
	PRISM integral equation theory for the fluid-fluid spinodals and
	osmotic compressibilities show good qualitative or semiquantitative
	agreement with all the experimental trends. The differences between
	good and ideal solvent conditions are largely attributed to changes
	in the polymer-polymer pair correlation functions due to the enhanced
	ability of coils to interpenetrate and cluster in theta solvents.
	Even for ideal solvent conditions the simplifying polymer model and
	statistical mechanical assumptions adopted by prior classic free
	volume and related approaches appear to miss fundamental aspects
	of the experimental behavior, especially for large size asymmetry
	ratios and/or moderate-to-high colloid volume fractions. The primary
	error can be identified with the approximation of a polymer chain
	by a phantom sphere with no conformational degrees of freedom. (C)
